# Pump.fun Substreams

Track all the **instructions** and **events** from the Pump.fun program in Solana.

This Substreams uses the Pump.fun Anchor IDL to decode instruction and event data.

## About Substreams

Substreams, is one of the production of The Graph, which allows you to stream data and sink it into a variety of places (a Postgres database, a JS application, or a Subgraph).

## Get Started

**NOTE:** This Substreams has been auto-generated by using the `substreams init` command of the Substreams CLI. Try it out!

### Run the Binary

A compiled Substreams project is contained in the `pump-fun-v0.1.0.spkg` file, which contains all the decoding logic of the Solana program.

1. Install the Substreams CLI.

2. Run the Substreams

```
substreams gui
```

### Build the Project

1. Install the Substreams CLI.

2. Build the project (you will need Rust installed)

```
substreams build
```

3. Run the Substreams

```
substreams init
```

## Sink into a SQL database

You can directly map the output of the `map_program_data` to a SQL database using the [SQL sink](https://docs.substreams.dev/how-to-guides/sinks/sql-sink).

This example also provide a `db_out` module, in case you need more control over the database insertions.
